     Oh, brave Sir Robin        ─────────█▄██▄█             He was not in the least bit scared
   He was not at all afraid     █▄█▄█▄█▄█▐█┼██▌█▄█▄█▄█▄█        To be mashed into a pulp
  To be killed in nasty ways    ███┼█████▐████▌█████┼███      Or to have his eyes gouged out
 Brave, brave, brave Sir Robin  █████████▐████▌█████████  And his elbows broken, brave Sir Robin
